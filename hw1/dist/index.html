    <p>My professional background centers around computer networks and technical support. I gained valuable experience through an internship with Cisco, where I worked extensively with data center operations. Additionally, I contributed to the field by providing technical support at Apple. My affinity for computer science stems from my childhood passion for using computers to create music and my innate ability to troubleshoot and fix technical issues. </p>
